📊 Project Name: PhonePe Transaction Insights Dashboard
The PhonePe Transaction Insights Dashboard is a full-stack data analytics and engineering project aimed at extracting, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing nationwide digital payment trends using the open-source data from PhonePe Pulse. The dashboard offers real-time insights into transaction types, user behavior, and regional digital payment adoption across India.

🎯 Project Objectives
Data Extraction: Programmatically extract structured and unstructured JSON data from PhonePe Pulse.

Data Transformation: Clean and normalize nested data into tabular format.

Database Integration: Load data into an SQLite relational database using a custom schema.

Advanced Analytics: Perform EDA and business intelligence using SQL + Python.

Dashboard Visualization: Deploy interactive Streamlit-based visual analytics.

Deployment Ready: Shareable via LocalTunnel/Netlify, built for easy extension.

📊 Key Features
Analytical Capabilities
📈 Transaction Trends: Analyze total transactions and values over time.

🧭 Regional Insights: Compare states and districts on UPI penetration.

💡 Top Performers: Identify top states, districts, and categories.

🛡 Insurance Analytics: Measure digital insurance growth by region.

📊 P2P vs Merchant Transactions: Behavioral segmentation.

Technical Highlights
✅ SQLite Database: Lightweight storage optimized for analytics.

✅ Streamlit Dashboard: Real-time filters, charts, maps.

✅ GeoJSON Maps: Interactive India heatmaps for visual region analysis.

✅ Unit Testing: Pytest-based validation for reliability.

✅ Modular Design: Separated ETL, SQL, frontend, testing modules.
